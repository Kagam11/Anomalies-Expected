						<text>Enhanced Cognitive Function Following Non-Standard Sleep\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details observations of Subject {PAWN_nameDef} following a period of sleep on ordinary bed. This deviated from the typical sleep protocol within the facility. While Subject exhibited abnormally rapid sleep and atypical brain activity, no adverse effects were noted. Interestingly, upon awakening, {PAWN_nameDef} reported newfound knowledge directly related to ongoing anomalies research in the facility. This information appears unrelated to prior exposure within the facility, suggesting unconventional pathways to data acquisition. Current research protocols may not be optimally suited to study this phenomenon. Further investigation is warranted.\n\nObservations:\n{PAWN_nameDef} was permitted to utilize ordinary bed for sleep, deviating from the standard protocol.\nSleep duration was significantly shorter than the norm for Subject.\nBrainwave patterns deviated from baseline readings during sleep.\nNo negative physical or behavioral changes were observed post-sleep.\n\nOutcome:\nUpon awakening, {PAWN_nameDef} reported novel information relevant to ongoing research on anomalies in the facility.\nThe reported information was not previously known to Subject and could not be attributed to standard briefings or exposure within the facility.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest a potential correlation between non-standard sleep and enhanced cognitive function, specifically related to anomaly research. Conventional research methods may not be sufficient to explore this phenomenon.\nTemporary anomalous bed has been classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther experimentation is required to substantiate these observations.  Additional tests with {PAWN_nameDef} and potentially other subjects are recommended to explore the potential of non-standard sleep and acquisition of research-relevant data.</text>

						<text>Potential Correlation with Fatigue of Colonists\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details observations concerning the effects of ordinary bed introduced into a research facility housing colonists. Following its arrival, a significant portion of the colonists exhibited increased fatigue. Notably, the severity of fatigue appeared to correlate directly with the frequency of experiments conducted utilizing the ordinary bed. These findings suggest a potential link between the ordinary bed and colonists well-being. Given this observation, continued experimentation with the ordinary bed is recommended with caution. Further investigation into the bed's properties and its impact on colonists' physiology is warranted.\n\nObservations:\nFollowing the introduction of ordinary bed into the facility, a notable increase in fatigue was observed amongst several colonists.\nThe severity of fatigue appears to be directly proportional to the number of experiments conducted utilizing the ordinary bed.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest a potential link between the ordinary bed and the colonists fatigue. The observed correlation between experiment frequency and fatigue intensity warrants further investigation.\n\nConsiderations:\nThe data aligns with previous observations regarding Subject's abnormal sleep on ordinary bed. Both instances deviate from the established rest protocols and suggest potential unforeseen consequences associated with standard sleep environments within the facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nGiven the potential detrimental effects, continued experimentation with the ordinary bed should be undertaken with caution. Further analysis of the ordinary bed's properties and its impact on colonists physiology is recommended.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Ordinary Bed and Enhanced Cognitive Function\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report presents a novel theory proposed by Subject {PAWN_nameDef} regarding ordinary bed introduced into a research facility. Subject suggests the bed interacts with the brain neurons of nearby colonists, facilitating enhanced information processing capacity within the sleeper and leading to faster sleep recovery. This theory is based on data obtained during an anomalous sleep event involving Subject and ordinary bed. As a result of this event, the anomaly associated with the bed has been classified as Safe. Report concludes by outlining two primary options for moving forward: termination of the experiment by destruction of the ordinary bed, or continued use under controlled conditions for potential gain of research information.\n\nHypothesis:\nFollowing their non-standard sleep experience, {PAWN_nameDef} has proposed a theory concerning the ordinary bed. Subject suggest the bed utilizes the brain neurons of colonists in its vicinity. This interaction, according to {PAWN_nameDef}, facilitates increased information processing capacity within the sleeper.\n\nDiscussion:\n{PAWN_nameDef}'s theory posits that by leveraging the colonists' collective neural network, the ordinary bed reduces the cognitive load on the sleeper's individual brain. This, in turn, would explain the observed rapid sleep recovery in Subject's case.\nBased on information gleaned during this anomalous sleep event, {PAWN_nameDef} has successfully classified the anomaly associated with the ordinary bed as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nConsiderations:\nThe potential validity of Subject's theory requires further investigation. Additionally, a critical decision must be made regarding the ordinary bed. Reclassification not required.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestruction: Given the potential for unforeseen consequences related to the standard bed's influence on colonists' neural activity, its destruction may be the most prudent course of action.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if Subject's theory regarding information processing holds merit, continued use of the standard bed, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer significant advantages in anomaly research. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>

						<text>Unexpected Shift in Anomalous Healing Properties\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nInitial success with an anomalous hospital bed showcasing rapid healing turned problematic in a follow-up experiment. Subject immersion in the crimson fluid, previously observed to heal injuries, resulted in no positive change and instead inflicted new minor wounds. The bed's accompanying medical clipboard displayed altered data.  While further knowledge was gained regarding the anomaly, this unexpected outcome necessitates a reevaluation of its functionality and a heightened safety protocol. The anomalous hospital bed has been reclassified as a Class-1 (Caution) anomaly due to its potential to inflict harm. Further experimentation is crucial to understand the cause of this shift in behavior.\n\nObservations:\nOne row was filled with small score on a medical clipboard.\nSubject requires some medical assistance.\n[REDACTED] instructed to lie down on a hospital bed.\nAfter short time a crimson fluid emerged from the bed frame, engulfing the Subject entirely.\nSubject's stress levels increased.\nFollowing another brief interval, the fluid was entirely absorbed back into the bed frame, uncovering Subject.\n[REDACTED] displayed signs of panic and examined its body.\nText changed on a medical clipboard.\n\nOutcome:\nAll previously documented injuries of the Subject remained unhealed.\n[REDACTED] manifested new superficial cuts and minor injuries on its body.\nRow with a score dissapeared on a medical clipboard. No additional row about [REDACTED] wasn't added.\nStudy knowledge was produced during this experiment surpassing that of the previous experiment.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe unexpected results of this experiment necessitate reevaluation of our understanding of this anomaly.\nReclassified anomalous hospital bed as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly.\n\nConsiderations:\nIt is crucial to note that the anomaly, unlike previously observed behavior, now demonstrates the potential to inflict harm. This poses a significant threat to the safety of colonists.\n\nRecommendations:\nGiven the potential detrimental effects, continued experimentation with the hospital bed should be undertaken with caution. \nFurther experimentation with injured subjects is required to determine the cause of such change of behaviour.</text>

						<text>Anomalous Bed Reveals Lethal Potential\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nA seemingly healthy [REDACTED] subjected to an anomalous hospital bed resulted in a catastrophic outcome. The hospital bed, previously exhibiting regenerative properties, inflicted significant injuries and tissue loss on the Subject, leading to its demise. The accompanying medical clipboard displayed a decrease in previously high scores, suggesting a potential correlation with the subject's outcome. Experiment highlighted the unpredictable and potentially lethal nature of the anomaly. The hospital bed has been reclassified as a Class-2 (Warning) anomaly. Further experimentation, prioritizing subject safety, is crucial to understand the factors influencing this erratic behavior. Notably, this trial demonstrates the potential use of healthy subjects in future research.\n\nObservations:\nFew rows was filled with big score on a medical clipboard.\nSubject didn't required medical assistance.\n[REDACTED] instructed to lie down on a hospital bed.\nAfter short time a crimson fluid emerged from the bed frame, engulfing the Subject entirely.\nSubject's stress levels escalated rapidly, culminating in audible screams.\nAfter screams stopped, the fluid was entirely absorbed back into the bed frame, uncovering Subject, or rather, what remained.\nTextual data on the medical clipboard changed.\n\nOutcome:\n[REDACTED] manifested significant new injuries and substantial tissue loss.\nSubject [REDACTED] expired due to extensive injuries.\nSeveral high-scoring entries on the medical clipboard disappeared. Remaining entries displayed a decrease in score. No new entry for Subject [REDACTED] was generated.\nStudy knowledge was produced during this experiment surpassing that of the first experiment.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe outcome of this experiment has left researchers profoundly disturbed.\nThis experiment also shows that use of healthy subjects is possible.\nReclassified anomalous hospital bed as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly, due to its demonstrated lethality.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther experimentation with injured subjects is imperative to establish the factors influencing such erratic behavior.</text>

						<text>Anomalous Medical Bed and Clipboard Reveal Interconnected Nature\n\nAbstract:\nThe anomalous hospital bed exhibits a peculiar connection to its accompanying medical clipboard. Attempts to remove the clipboard resulted in its transformation into a liquid and subsequent reintegration with the bed frame. A new clipboard then materialized, replicating the previous one's data. Analysis of past observations suggests the clipboard acts as a log of interactions with the medical bed. New entries appear upon successful healing (accompanied by a score), while filled rows seem to increase the risk of subject injury, with the severity potentially linked to the total score. This revelation emphasizes the importance of scrutinizing the clipboard's information before using the anomalous hospital bed to enhance safety and potentially unlock the key to understanding of its operation.\n\nObservations:\nAn attempt was made to remove the medical clipboard from the bed.\nUpon moving the clipboard more than one meter away from the bed, it transformed into a liquid state and flowed back onto the hospital bed frame.\nMoments later, a new medical clipboard solidified on top of the bed.\n\nOutcome:\nRemoval of the medical clipboard was unsuccessful.\nThe newly formed clipboard displayed a copy of the previous clipboard's data.\n\nDiscussion:\nConsidering all previous changes in text on a medical clipboard it should be safe to assume that it provides information related to operation that will happen with subject on a medical bed.\nWhen a subject is successfully healed, a new row appears on the clipboard with a corresponding score. This score likely reflects the amount of regeneration that occurred.\nConversely, when rows on the clipboard are not empty, there is a possibility of the subject sustaining injuries. The severity of these injuries seems to correlate with the sum of the scores on the clipboard.\n\nConsiderations:\nAn observer has identified a potential pattern: the likelihood of a subject experiencing injury from the hospital bed appears to be directly related to the percentage of filled rows on the medical clipboard.\n\nRecommendations:\nIt is imperative to pay close attention to the information displayed on the medical clipboard before utilizing the medical bed on a subject. This information may hold the key to safely operating the anomaly.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Anomalous Medical Bed\n\nAbstract:\nThis report presents a novel theory proposed by one of observers of anomalous medical bed regarding it functionality. Anomaly was labeled as Emergency Cellular Restoration Unit (ECRU). It suggested that ECRU function by utilizing a regenerative crimson liquid stored within its frame. Analysis suggests this liquid repairs human tissue, but requires refilling. The accompanying clipboard may track depletion and indicate refill urgency. A disturbing theory proposes the ECRU consumes tissues of some subject's for refilling, potentially fatally. Research aims to replicate the liquid for safer medical use. The report recommends either destroying the ECRU or implementing strict protocols for controlled use.\n\nHypothesis:\nAn observer, drawing upon observations from all experiments and information gleaned from surviving subjects, has proposed a theory concerning the Emergency Cellular Restoration Unit functionality. The ECRU frame likely houses a reservoir containing a regenerative crimson liquid that stimulates human tissue repair. The accompanying medical clipboard potentially tracks the liquid's depletion and indicates the urgency of refilling. When a refill is necessary, next subject's tissues will be consumed to produce liquid. The outcome for the subject depends on the volume required, with a potential risk of fatality. A portion of the liquid might be used to maintain the functionality of the organic metal frame.\n\nDiscussion:\nWe might be able to use this knowledge to replicate production of this liquid of lower concentration for usage between colonists.\nAnomalous medical bed was renamed to Emergency Cellular Restoration Unit.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestruction: Given the potential for accidental death on this medical bed, its destruction may be the most prudent course of action.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if hypothesis is right, then continued use of ECRU, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer significant advantages in medical care. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>

						<text>Analysis of an Automated Meat Grinder\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nAn industrial-looking metal box functioned as an automated meat grinder. Upon activation, it collected nearby corpses, processed them into fist-sized meat and leather chunks, and deactivated after butchering all available corpses. Processed materials exhibited no anomalous properties. The meat grinder's lack of apparent power source warrants further investigation. Classified as Class-0 (Safe).\n\nObservations:\nDeceased animal specimens were placed in proximity to the industrial-looking metal box. {PAWN_nameDef} was instructed to press the button. Upon activation, small access doors on the sides automatically opened. A thin, metallic manipulator arms emerged from the access door and deposited corpse into a central processing chamber. Subject reported of hearing sounds of corpse being cut and crushed. Fist-sized chunks of processed meat and leather were ejected from one of the access doors. After some time, when there was no corpses left around it, it deactivated itself.\n\nOutcome:\nAll deceased animal specimens around metal box were successfully butchered. Analysis of the processed meat and leather revealed no anomalous properties.\n\nDiscussion:\nIndustrial-looking metal box appears to function as an automated meat grinder. Activation via a button triggers the retrieval of corpses, butchering, and expulsion of processed materials. It doesn't seems to require any power input, reason of which requires further investigation.\nTemporary meat grinder has been classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther observation is required to explore it other possible anomalous effects.</text>

						<text>Unveiling the Sound-Efficiency Link\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nPreviously safe meat grinder exhibited aggressive behavior during routine testing. A weak, previously unnoticed sound correlated with reaction from manipulator that injured personnel. Butchering efficiency appears to be linked to the sound, with higher sound levels leading to increased output. The anomaly has been reclassified as Class-1 (Caution) due to safety concerns. Further investigation is required to understand the sound's role and prevent future incidents.\n\nObservations:\nA weak sound was reported emanating from the meat grinder. Standard experiment procedures were initiated. Upon activation attempt, an access door opened unexpectedly, and a manipulator arm pushed [REDACTED] towards the processing chamber. Subject experienced increased stress and sustained a bleeding hand injury. Meat grinder continued its processing function as observed in previous experiments. The weak sound reportedly disappeared after a few corpses were butchered.\n\nOutcome:\n[REDACTED] lost a finger due to the incident.\nMaximum sound level measured 40 dB.\nThe amount of processed meat and leather increased compared to previous experiments that lacked the sound.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe potential for harm appears linked to the previously unnoticed weak sound emanating from the meat grinder. The sound level might influence the efficiency of the butchering process. Sound level decrease with amount of corpses processed by the meat grinder.\nReclassified meat grinder as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly.\n\nConsiderations:\nThis incident highlights a significant shift in the anomaly's behavior compared to earlier observations. Its potential to cause harm poses a serious threat to personnel safety.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther observation is crucial to understand the sound's role in the process.</text>

						<text>Sound as a Predictor of Injury\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nExperiments revealed a concerning link between sound level and injury risk during activation of an anomalous meat grinder. Higher sound levels (0 dB = safe, 90 dB = critical limb loss) correlated with increased injury severity. The grinder's sound level appears to rise over time, suggesting potentially even greater dangers. Notably, processing human corpses seems to temporarily reduce the sound similar to using multiple animal specimens. Extreme caution and sound monitoring are crucial before activation.\n\nObservations:\nMultiple experiments were conducted, with a focus on recording sound levels during operation.\n\nOutcome:\nA clear correlation was observed between sound level and the severity of injuries sustained by [REDACTED] during activation attempts:\n- 0 dB = Safe\n- 40 dB = Finger loss\n- 60 dB = Hand or Foot loss\n- 90 dB = Leg or Arm loss\n\nDiscussion:\nHigher sound levels appear to correlate with a greater risk of the subject being drawn into the processing chamber and sustaining severe injuries. The sound level generated by the meat grinder seems to rise over time, suggesting a potential for even higher sound levels (beyond the observed 90 dB).\nInterestingly, processing human corpses appears to temporarily reduce the sound level similar to using multiple similar animal corpses.\n\nRecommendations:\nExtreme caution is advised before activating the meat grinder. Personnel should prioritize monitoring sound levels during operation.</text>

						<text>Security Breach and Tragedy\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nUnauthorized access to meat grinder resulted in a lethal incident. Subject [REDACTED] exhibited atypical behavior before activation and jumping into the machine. A one hour window for intervention was observed. Maximum sound level reached 130 dB before dropping significantly after subject perished. The meat grinder has been reclassified as Class-2 (Warning) due to the potential for self-harm of personel. Focus on increased security and monitoring of containment room is recommended.\n\nObservations:\nSecurity footage identified [REDACTED] entering the meat grinder containment area without authorization. During this unauthorized access, [REDACTED] exhibited unusual behavior, including humming and staring intently at the machine for approximately one hour. Subject then activated the meat grinder and jumped into the central processing chamber.\nA facility janitor discovered blood on the containment room floor during a routine cleaning and raised the alarm.\n\nOutcome:\nMaximum sound level recorded during the incident was 130 dB. Sound levels dropped significantly following the disappearance of [REDACTED] within the machine.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis incident necessitates a reevaluation of the potential risks associated with the meat grinder. \nThe approximately one hour timeframe between initial interaction and activation suggests potential avenues for intervention before it too late for the subject.\nReclassified meat grinder as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly, due to incident with [REDACTED].\n\nRecommendations:\nFacility should be put on high alert and Overseers should be vigilant in monitoring all activity near the containment room to prevent future lethal incidents.\nFurther investigation is essential to understand the potential factors influencing anomalous behavior in personnel interacting with the meat grinder.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Meat Grinder\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nDrilling into the anomalous Symphony of Eternal Slaughter revealed human organs and a brain sustained by an organic-metallic life support system. Scans matched the internal sounds with humming reported during a prior unauthorized access lethal incident. A hypothesis proposes a dissected person inside psychically attracts and consumes others for self-preservation, with stress levels impacting processing efficiency. Distraction may disrupt control. Destruction is recommended due to safety concerns, though controlled use offers potential benefits if risks are mitigated.\n\nObservations:\n[REDACTED] utilized drilling equipment to create an opening in one of the meat grinder's access doors. Following the initial drilling, blood was observed leaking from the interior of the machine. [REDACTED] reported hearing a heartbeat and witnessing muscle contractions within the meat grinder.\nScans were conducted through the newly created opening, revealing the presence of human organs and a brain inside.\n\nOutcome:\nThe scans revealed human organs, including a brain, located within the organic metal core of the meat grinder. These organs appear to be maintained by a life support system constructed from a network of twisted flesh.\nAdditional sound analysis revealed similarities between the detected sounds and the humming reported by [REDACTED] during the unauthorized access incident.\n\nHypothesis:\nBased on the report by [REDACTED], the following theory regarding the Symphony of Eternal Slaughter is proposed by one of observers. A dissected human is contained within the organic metal core of the machine, with their organs and brain kept functional through a life support system. This potentially reflects an unorthodox method, employed by archotech scientists, to automate the butchering process without rellying on artificial intelligence. To maintain itself, this person might utilize a form of singing on psychic level to attract living humans. Consumed alive humans or their body parts may be used to sustain the person by providing bodily fluids and cells, allowing for self-sustenance. Increased stress levels within the person could potentially correlate with higher processing efficiency, possibly as a means of attracting attention and ensure flow of corpses and bodies.\n\nDiscussion:\nIt is theorized that effective distraction of a subject affected by the singing could potentially disrupt control of the meat grinder and prevent a lethal incident.\n\nRecommendations:\nRemoval: Given the potential for accidental death, it destruction maybe the best coarse of action. This approach could also potentially provide access to samples of meat grinder person's body parts from it.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if hypothesis is right, then continued use of meat grinder, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer substantial benefits in terms of corpse butchering. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>
