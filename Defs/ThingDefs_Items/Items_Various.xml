						<text>Enhanced Learning and Divine Inspiration\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nConsumption of a giant anomalous apple led to a drastic increase in learning speed and knowledge retention in the Subject. The Subject reported experiencing divine inspiration and a heightened understanding of a divine entity. Further research is needed to understand the source of the knowledge and potential long-term effects.\n\nObservations:\nSubject was instructed to bite the apple and swallow the piece. After consumption, [REDACTED] reported experiencing a surge of divine inspiration, accompanied by a newfound sense of wisdom. Notably, the Subject achieved a breakthrough on a previously encountered task that had posed an initial challenge.\nSubject was then instructed to consume another bite of the apple. [REDACTED] reported a further increase in their understanding of the divine will.\n\nOutcome:\nSubject demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge retention and learning speed compared to pre-experiment baseline.\n[REDACTED] described gaining access to previously unconsidered perspectives and experiencing a heightened sense of connection to a divine entity.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest that consumption of the anomalous apple facilitates accelerated learning and knowledge acquisition in the subject. The rate of learning appears to correlate with the amount of apple consumed. \nFurther investigation is required to determine the source of this knowledge and the potential long-term effects of repeated exposure.\n\nRecommendations:\nContinued experimentation with controlled apple consumption is necessary to fully understand the cognitive effects on the subject. Monitoring of the subject's health and mental state is crucial throughout the research process.</text>

						<text>The Forbidden Fruit of Knowledge\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nFurther consumption of the anomalous apple yielded greater knowledge, but triggered fear and connection to an angered divine entity perceiving the fruit as forbidden. The subject fainted and reported about potential death from continuation of consumption. The experiment highlights long-term risks and necessitates an inhibitor serum to counter the connection. The anomaly has been reclassified as Class-1 (Caution).\n\nObservations:\nFollowing previous successful trials with partial apple consumption, Subject was instructed to repeat the procedure. [REDACTED] reported a significantly larger influx of knowledge compared to prior experiences. However, Subject also exhibited signs of mild dizziness and expressed a troubling feeling that the acquired knowledge was not meant for them.\nFurther consumption of the apple resulted in a partial loss of consciousness and fear in Subject. [REDACTED] reported establishing a partial connection with a divine entity, who expressed anger at their consumption of The Forbidden Fruit. Subject displayed agitation, screaming about never touching the fruit again and pleading for forgiveness.\n\nOutcome:\n[REDACTED] experienced significant stress and subsequently fainted.\nUpon regaining consciousness, Subject explained that he was able to partially understand the divine entity and its anger regarding the consumption of the forbidden fruit, which was not meant for humans. [REDACTED] further reported that continued interaction with the fruit during this entity's Wrath could result in their death.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis experiment highlights the potential risks associated with long-term exposure to the apple's effects.\nNotably, one researcher proposed the development of an inhibitor serum to potentially counter the subject's connection with the divine entity.\nReclassified holy apple of knowledge as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly, due to reaction and information from [REDACTED].\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther experimentation with the proposed inhibitor serum is necessary to assess its effectiveness in mitigating the negative effects of the apple.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Giant Apple\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nInhibitor serum successfully severed the connection between a [REDACTED] and a higher-dimensional entity triggered by consuming a forbidden knowledge fruit. The disconnection caused a temporary learning speed decline but no lasting harm. Subject theorizes the fruit originates from the entity's garden and facilitates knowledge exchange. The entity fears humanity reaching its level and hinders excessive knowledge gain. Removal or controlled use with safety protocols are recommended for the giant apple.\n\nObservations:\nSubject was instructed to inject giant apple inhibitor serum during divine entity's Wrath period. Following the injection, [REDACTED] reported a significant decrease in stress levels and a diminished ability to perceive the entity's voice. Subject further described a general sense of improvement. \nAfter several days, [REDACTED] confirmed a complete severance of the connection with the divine entity.\n\nOutcome:\nGiant apple inhibitor serum successfully severed Subject's connection with the divine entity. \nHowever, Subject also experienced a temporary decline in learning speed over the course of the observation period.\n\nHypothesis:\nBased on the overall experience, [REDACTED] proposes a theory regarding the origin of The Forbidden Fruit of Knowledge. Subject suggests that the fruit originates from a garden controlled by the encountered divine entity. Consumption of the fruit establishes a connection between the consumer's consciousness and the entity, facilitating the exchange of knowledge and thoughts. [REDACTED] further hypothesizes that the divine entity, existing in a higher dimension, possesses the capability to observe and potentially influence our facility on a level not accessible to humans. The appearance of the fruit outside our facility is attributed to interdimensional travel. While the entity seems indifferent to lower levels of knowledge access, it fears the potential of humanity achieving its level of understanding. This fear manifests as attempts to hinder excessive knowledge acquisition through the fruit. Disconnecting from the entity's mind via the serum injection allows it to gradually forget about our existence, similar to how a human might forget an insignificant ant encountered in an anthill.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe severance of the connection with the entity through the serum requires time and comes with a temporary learning speed penalty. However, post-disconnection observations indicate no lasting negative effects for the subject.\n\nRecommendations:\nRemoval: Given the potential for accidental death due to excessive consumption, it removal from facility may be the most prudent course of action.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if hypothesis is right, then continued use of giant apple, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer substantial benefits in terms of learning and knowledge acquisition. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>

						<text>The Indestructible Vatrushka\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nA seemingly ordinary vatrushka exhibited remarkable resilience. Standard tools and fire failed to damage the pastry or its plate, which displayed self-repair capabilities. Consumption attempts proved impossible due to its impregnability. Classified as Class-0 (Safe) with further investigation recommended.\n\nObservations:\nSubject was presented with a standard steel knife. {PAWN_nameDef} attempted to cut a piece of big pie, but to no avail.\nSubject attempted to smash big pie on a plate onto solid ground. While the plate holding the big pie cracked upon impact, the crack spontaneously repaired itself within moments.\n{PAWN_nameDef} exposed big pie to a controlled fire for 30 minutes. Upon extinguishing the fire, the pie exhibited no signs of charring or melting.\nSubject was instructed to attempt biting a portion of the vatrushka without swallowing.

						<text>Vatrushka Replication and its Implications\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nAnomalous vatrushka displayed self-replication, generating a consumable piece of pie on it own plate. The consumed piece exhibited normal digestion, but slowed Subject's movement. This suggests that vatrushka might provide sustenance while requiring further study of its risks. Controlled consumption warrants exploration as a solution to food shortages.\n\nObservations:\nSecurity footage revealed the spontaneous appearance of a smaller piece of pie within the containment area.\nThis smaller piece underwent testing identical to the original, exhibiting the same anomalous properties as big pie.\nDue to its smaller size, [REDACTED] was able to fully consume the replicated piece.\nThe subject reported a feeling of heaviness in their stomach but no other abnormalities.\nNotably, the plate previously holding the replicated piece vaporized upon piece consumption\n\nOutcome:\nSubsequent scans revealed the consumed pie piece undergoing a slow digestion process within [REDACTED]'s stomach. Interestingly, this digestion coincided with a decrease in the subject's movement speed.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe big pie appears capable of self-replication, generating smaller pieces that retain the original's anomalous properties. Further investigation is required to understand the mechanism behind this replication\nInterestingly, the consumed piece displayed normal nutritional value during digestion. This suggests the possibility of the vatrushka serving as a potential solution to food shortages within the facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nControlled consumption of replicated pie pieces should be considered as a means to address potential food shortages.\nStrict monitoring of the number of replicated pieces within containment is crucial to prevent overabundance.</text>

						<text>Possible Containment Overflow\n\nAbstract:\nThe anomalous big pie replicates proportionally to its existing pieces. Consumed pieces don't affect replication rate. Controlled consumption is necessary to prevent overwhelming facility with pie pieces.\n\nObservations:\nAn extensive review of security footage was conducted, focusing on the frequency and quantity of replicated pie pieces appearing within the containment area.\n\nOutcome:\nA clear correlation was identified between the number of existing pie pieces and the number of newly replicated pieces:\n- Big pie = new 1 piece\n- Big pie + 1 piece = new 2 piece\n- Big pie + 3 piece = new 4 piece\n- Big pie + 1 piece + 2 consumed piece = new 2 piece\nThe time interval between the appearance of new pieces was approximately 24 hours.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe number of newly replicated pie pieces appears directly proportional to the total number of existing pieces within the containment area. Notably, the consumption of previously replicated pieces does not seem to impact the rate of new piece generation\nThis uncontrolled replication poses a significant risk of overwhelming the containment area with pie pieces. Careful monitoring and controlled consumption of newly replicated pieces are crucial to maintain a manageable quantity.\n\nRecommendations:\nThe implementation of a controlled consumption program for newly replicated vatrushka pieces is recommended to regulate the total number of pieces within the facility.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Big Pie\n\nAbstract:\nSelf-Baking Pies (SBP) exhibits potential for interdimensional travel and exponential growth. Hypothesis suggests offspring drain resources of the planet and mature into similar entities. Humans possess a possible defense mechanism in their genes through digestion. Destruction or controlled use with robust safety protocols are recommended.\n\nHypothesis:\nBased on observations from all experiments, a theory regarding the Self-Baking Pies (SBP) origin and behavior was proposed.\nA remarkable colony of sentient yeast that have made cake their primary habitat.\nIt suggested that it possesses a potential for interdimensional travel. Upon arriving in a world with suitable conditions (oxygen-rich atmosphere and abundant organic/mineral content), it transporting offspring to current dimension\nEach offspring facilitates the SBP's interdimensional travel by gathering energy from the surrounding environment.\nOnce all offspring are transferred, they consume resources of the planet to grow and mature into entities similar to the original SBP, allowing continued exponential propagation across realities.\nThe SBP exhibits exceptional resilience to external damage, but may be susceptible to degradation by concentrated stomach acid within a human digestive system.\nWhile this poses an existential threat due to potential uncontrolled spread, our digestive systems appear to contain unique genes that enable the destruction of SBP regenrative capabilities. This implies a potential past encounter between humanity and SBP entities, resulting in an evolutionary defense mechanism against their colonization efforts.\n\nDiscussion:\nFurther research should explore the possibility of utilizing highly concentrated stomach acid to weaken the main SBP, potentially enabling full consumption. It's important to note that this approach could have a more significant impact on the consumer compared to consuming individual SBP pieces.\nThe current classification of the SBP remains Class-0 (Safe) as it does not pose an immediate threat to personnel within the facility.\n\n[High Level Access Required]:\nThe potential for rapid, uncontrolled SBP replication poses a significant risk. We must closely monitor the number of existing SBP pieces. Loss of control could elevate the threat level to higher than even Class-4, potentially causing our reality to succumb to SBP and end up being consumed. Drawing from simulated reality theory, an uncontrolled spread of SBP pieces could potentially lead to a system crash, if their numbers reach critical levels.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestruction: Given the potential for exponential growth, destruction of the vatrushka using concentrated stomach acid may be the most prudent course of action\nControlled Use: If the hypothesis holds true, continued utilization of the vatrushka under controlled and monitored conditions could offer a sustainable food source for the facility. This approach, however, requires thorough risk assessment and robust safety protocols to prevent uncontrolled replication.</text>

						<text>Interactive Knowledge Conduit\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details the examination of yellow notepad. The notepad, upon inputting a specific skill, dynamically generates content related to that skill. The subject who interacted with the notepad experienced a significant increase in their medical knowledge after inputting "Medical". The notepad exhibited no hostile behavior and reverted to its original state post-examination. Given its passive nature and potential for knowledge acquisition, the notepad is provisionally classified as a Class-0 (Safe) anomaly. Further research is recommended to fully understand its capabilities and limitations.\n\nObservations:\nUpon initial examination, {PAWN_nameDef} observed a notepad containing numerous pages filled with research notes on diverse topics.\nSubject reported noticing a field on each page for inputting a specific "Skill".\n{PAWN_nameDef} was instructed to input the "Medical" into this field.\nSubsequently, the content on subsequent pages transformed to focus on medical topics.\nUpon examining this pages, Subject reported that text dissapeared from them.\n\nOutcome:\nThroughout the examination, the notepad displayed no hostile.\nFollowing the examination, all pages within the notepad reverted to a blank state. Additionally {PAWN_nameDef} experienced an improvement in their medical skills.\n\nDiscussion:\nIt appears that the quantity of experience gained by the Subject is correlated with the number of pages that manifested within the notepad. \nGiven the absence of hostile behavior, the notepad has been temporary classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nContinued research and utilization of notepad is required to further investigate its anomalous properties and explore potential applications.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Yellow Notepad\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details the anomalous properties of a yellow notepad. The notepad seems to be a tool for knowledge acquisition and organization. It responds to user input by generating relevant content, and its capabilities appear to expand as more knowledge is fed into it. The notepad's origins remain unknown, but it is hypothesized to be an ancient artifact that once belonged to a vast library. Continued usage is recommended to utilize its anomalous properties.\n\nOutcome:\nSome of colonists have demonstrated increased motivation to conduct anomaly research within the facility, with the aim of acquiring expertise in their respective fields through the utilization of the notepad.\n\nDiscussion:\nIt appears that the quantity of pages generated by the notepad is correlated with the amount of anomaly research conducted within the facility. \nGiven the consistent and non-hostile behavior of the notepad, its current classification as a Class-0 (Safe) anomaly remains unchanged.\n\nHypothesis:\n{PAWN_nameDef} has proposed a theory suggesting that the notepad may interact with various information carriers, including papers, blueprints, and digital storage devices. It is theorized that the notepad absorbs knowledge gained within the facility and, in exchange, provides requested information to its users. Driven by an insatiable curiosity, the notepad seeks human interaction to expand its knowledge. While its exact origin remains elusive, it is speculated that the notepad may have originated from an ancient library. It is speculated that the notepad was used to organize and access vast amounts of information within the library. Evidence of fire damage on certain pages suggests that the library may have been destroyed by fire, forcing the notepad to seek new owners.\n\nRecommendations:\nControlled Use: Continued anomaly research within the facility and usage of the notepad are recommended to utilize its anomalous properties.</text>

						<text>The Ideology of Worshiping the Provider Deity\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details the initial examination of an ancient book containing religious texts related to a deity known as "Provider." The book, despite its age, displayed no damage. Analysis revealed descriptions of the Provider deity, along with blueprints for a specific box and prayers for a ritual. The book's seemingly infinite pages and the lack of hostile reactions led to its temporary classification as a Class-0 (Safe) anomaly. Further research and construction of the box are recommended to gain deeper insights into the Provider deity and its associated ideology.\n\nObservations:\nUpon initial examination, {PAWN_nameDef} observed an aged yet robust book a substantial number of pages related to a some deity.\nSubject reported encountering a blueprint-like image on page [REDACTED].\nThe reading experiment was terminated after several hours.\n\nOutcome:\nThroughout the examination, the scripture displayed no hostile. \nA significant portion of its pages comprises descriptions of a deity referred to as "Provider" by an ancient civilization.\nSeveral pages contained images of a particular box along with detailed instructions for its creation.\nNumerous pages were dedicated to prayers associated with a specific ritual.\nWhile appearing as a conventional book, neither the cover nor the paper pages displayed any signs of damage. \nAdditionally, regardless of the number of pages turned, {PAWN_nameDef} did not reach the end of the book. Due to this, the experiment was terminated prematurely.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis book appears to be a scripture associated with an ideology centered around the Provider deity. Throughout the pages, this deity is depicted positively and is an object of worship.\nGiven the absence of hostile behavior, the scripture has been temporary classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nContinued research and construction of the box based on the provided blueprint are necessary to acquire further knowledge about this deity.</text>

						<text>Results of the Ritual\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report documents an experiment involving a sacrificial items offering to the Provider deity. A quantity of silver was placed in a designated box during a ritual. Upon completion of the ritual, the silver vanished from the box, and an equivalent amount of silver with altered properties appeared before the chanters. The successful outcome was attributed to the deity's satisfaction with the prayers offered. The findings suggest a correlation between the quality of the prayers and the quantity of the returned offering. Continued research is recommended to optimize the process and further understand the nature of the deity's interactions.\n\nObservations:\nA box was prepared in advance and placed adjacent to the designated ritual spot. \nA quantity of silver was deposited within the box. Upon the commencement of the ritual, the silver within the box vanished. \nFollowing the conclusion of the ritual, an equivalent amount of silver materialized in front of the chanters.\n\nOutcome:\nA detailed analysis of the recovered silver revealed distinct differences from the silver initially placed within the box. While the quantity of silver remained identical in both instances, notable variations were observed. \n{PAWN_nameDef} reported hearing that the deity was pleased with the offered prayers.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe findings suggest the possibility of offering items as sacrifices to the Provider deity. The quantity of appearing equivalent of the sacrificed item seems to be contingent upon the deity's satisfaction with the accompanying prayers. It is hypothesized that the quantity of items received may diminish in cases where the quality of the prayers is deemed insufficient.\n\nRecommendations:\nContinued research of the scripture's pages is deemed necessary to comprehend the mechanisms for enhancing the relationship with this deity and improving the outcomes of future offerings.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Ancient Scripture\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report outlines the findings from the continued analysis of an ancient scripture related to the Provider deity. A significant portion of the scripture has been digitized, and research indicates that the facility's anomaly research activities are perceived as offerings by the deity, potentially influencing resource acquisition. A hypothesis suggests that an ancient civilization, overly reliant on the Provider, ultimately declined due to resource scarcity and external pressures. The scripture remains classified as Class-0 (Safe), and continued anomaly research is recommended as a controlled means of interacting with the deity and potentially benefiting from this anomalous resource acquisition.\n\nOutcome:\nA substantial portion of the scripture's pages were mapped and subsequently integrated into a comprehensive digital database for archival purposes.\n\nDiscussion:\nIt appears that the facility's ongoing anomaly research activities are also perceived as sacrifices by the Provider deity, resulting in a higher level of divine favor compared to previous observations. This increased favor may manifest as a disproportionate increase in the quantity of received items relative to the amount of sacrificed items.\nGiven the textual content left by the ancient civilization and non-hostile behavior of the scripture, its current classification as a Class-0 (Safe) anomaly remains unchanged.\n\nHypothesis:\n{PAWN_nameDef} has proposed a hypothesis regarding the origins of this ancient scripture. Based on its content, it can be theorized that a long-lost civilization encountered a deity early in its history. This encounter led to the establishment of a worship system centered around the deity, who was believed to provide essential resources. The civilization subsequently flourished, constructing numerous temples and integrating the worship of the Provider deity into its core ideology. In return, the deity continued to bestow a variety of resources, facilitating the progress and development of this civilization. However, over time, the civilization became overly reliant on The One Who Provides, neglecting its own internal development and inadvertently provoking the enmity of neighboring civilizations. As the civilization's progress stagnated, the deity's interest waned, leading to a significant decrease in the provision of resources. Ultimately, the civilization succumbed to external pressures due to resource scarcity, leaving behind only this scripture as a testament to its existence and the existence of the deity.\n\nRecommendations:\nControlled Use: Continued anomaly research within the facility is recommended to utilize this anomalous source of resources through ritual offering to the Provider deity.</text>

						<text>Festive Association\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report describes the initial examination of an anomalous Christmas stockings. The stockings displayed an anomalous internal volume, containing multiple gifts. While initial item retrieval was successful, subsequent attempts by same Subject were unsuccessful. Despite this, no hostile behavior was observed. Continued research and item retrieval attempts are recommended to further investigate properties of the stockings.\n\nObservations:\nUpon initial examination, {PAWN_nameDef} observed a red stockings that seems to contain some items inside.\nSubject attempted to take an item from within the stockings.\nIn the result, {PAWN_nameDef} pulled out a candy cane.\nSubject attempted to take another item from within the stockings.\n{PAWN_nameDef} reported an inability to retrieve further items, as if something was preventing further item extraction.\n\nOutcome:\nThroughout the examination, the stockings displayed no hostile.\nAfter recieving this candy cane gift, Subject's mood lifted for quite a long time.\n\nDiscussion:\nSurface analysis indicated similarity in design with stockings used during Christmas to contain gifts inside.\nPreliminary observations suggest the stockings contains a substantial quantity of items. However, following the retrieval of a single item, further extraction attempts by same Subject were unsuccessful.\nThis phenomenon may indicate that the stockings possesses an internal volume exceeding its external dimensions.\nGiven the absence of hostile behavior, the stockings has been temporary classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther research, including continued attempts to retrieve items from the stockings, is necessary to fully understand its anomalous properties.</text>

						<text>Last Gift?\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nThis report describes an anomalous event during the retrieval of the final gift from a Christmas stockings. The Subject experienced an influx of cold air and encountered an unexpectedly large object within. Subsequent withdrawal resulted in multiple punctures from spruce needles. Analysis suggests the final gift may be a large object covered in spruce foliage. Extraction requires careful preparation and safety precautions.\n\nObservations:\nUpon retrieval of the final gift from within the stockings, [REDACTED] reported a sensation of cold air emanating from the deep within the stockings.\nSubject was instructed to move their arm further into the stockings.\n[REDACTED] reported that the item within the stockings appeared to be significantly larger than previous gifts.\nSubject screamed and quickly pulled out the hand from inside of stockings.\n\nOutcome:\nSubsequent inspection of [REDACTED]'s hand revealed multiple punctures consistent with green needles.\n\nDiscussion:\nAnalysis of the needles confirmed their origin as belonging to a spruce tree.\nThe presence of spruce needles suggests the final gift within the stockings may be of significant size and covered with spruce needles or even branches.\n\nRecommendations:\nExtraction of the final gift from the stockings is recommended, following appropriate safety precautions and preparation.</text>
